#Formula 1 Race Strategy Analysis and Simulation
This repository contains a set of Python tools and scripts I developed to analyze and simulate Formula 1 race strategies with a focus on race dynamics, weather conditions, and race interruptions such as safety cars and red flags.

#Project Overview
Understanding Formula 1 race strategy is a complex challenge involving dynamic factors like tyre management, pit stops, weather, and unpredictable race events. This project uses Python, Dash, and Monte Carlo simulations to model and visualize how these variables impact race outcomes.

The goal is to provide interactive, data-driven insights into strategic decisions made by teams during a race — supporting better understanding of race flow, laptime variations, and the effects of weather and interruptions on final results.

This project is intended to showcase my skills in data analysis, simulation, and visualization, with a focus on motorsport applications.

#Key Features
Race Simulation: Monte Carlo-based models simulate race scenarios incorporating rain, safety cars, and red flag suspensions, capturing realistic race variability.

Data Processing: Import and analyze official FIA race timing and event data to generate accurate race models.

Interactive Dashboards: Build interactive, web-based Dash applications for visualizing race strategies and laptime distributions.

Strategic Insights: Identify critical moments where strategy changes, weather, or interruptions affected race outcomes.

Flexible Scenario Analysis: Adjust simulation parameters (e.g., rain likelihood, safety car timing) to explore "what-if" race scenarios.

#Why This Project Matters
Formula 1 race strategy combines high-speed decision-making with complex variable interactions. This project highlights the value of:

Data-Driven Strategy: Using real race data and simulations to support optimal pit stop timing and tyre management.

Adaptability: Modeling the impact of unpredictable factors like weather and race interruptions on strategy.

Visualization: Presenting complex race data in accessible, interactive formats to help engineers and analysts interpret key performance factors.
