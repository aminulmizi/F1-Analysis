# Formula 1 Race Strategy Analysis and Simulation

This repository contains a set of Python tools and scripts I developed to analyze and simulate Formula 1 race strategies with a focus on race dynamics, weather conditions, and race interruptions such as safety cars and red flags.

## Project Overview

Understanding Formula 1 race strategy is a complex challenge involving dynamic factors like tyre management, pit stops, weather, and unpredictable race events. This project uses **Python**, **Dash**, and **Monte Carlo simulations** to model and visualize how these variables impact race outcomes.

The goal is to provide interactive, data-driven insights into strategic decisions made by teams during a race â€” supporting better understanding of race flow, laptime variations, and the effects of weather and interruptions on final results.

This project showcases my skills in data analysis, simulation, and visualization, with a focus on motorsport applications.

## Key Features

- **Race Simulation**  
  Monte Carlo-based models simulate race scenarios incorporating rain, safety cars, and red flag suspensions, capturing realistic race variability.

- **Data Processing**  
  Import and analyze official FIA race timing and event data to generate accurate race models.

- **Interactive Dashboards**  
  Web-based Dash apps for visualizing race strategies and laptime distributions.

- **Strategic Insights**  
  Identify critical moments where strategy changes, weather, or interruptions affected race outcomes.

- **Flexible Scenario Analysis**  
  Adjust simulation parameters (e.g., rain likelihood, safety car timing) to explore *what-if* race scenarios.

## Why This Project Matters

Formula 1 race strategy combines high-speed decision-making with complex variable interactions. This project highlights the value of:

- **Data-Driven Strategy**  
  Using real race data and simulations to support optimal pit stop timing and tyre management.

- **Adaptability**  
  Modeling the impact of unpredictable factors like weather and race interruptions on strategy.

- **Visualization**  
  Presenting complex race data in accessible, interactive formats to help engineers and analysts interpret key performance factors.
